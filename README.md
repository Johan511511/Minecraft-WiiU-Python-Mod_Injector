# Minecraft-WiiU-Python-Mod_Injector

As the title states this is a mod injector for Minecraft: Wii U edition.

This is just a simple tkinter GUI to send Memory Write codes to your game, these codes include things like Fly and Kill Aura, etc.

## Setup:

### NOTICE! IP.py is no longer required! I have added a way to set the IP_Addr variable from in the GUI.

### The following modules are required!

Tkinter


### To Run:

After your IP is set in the IP.py file simply run KorozinRMTv2.py like any other .py file.
